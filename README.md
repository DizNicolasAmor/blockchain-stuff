# Blockchain stuff

This directory uses `git submodules`. It contains some blockchain projects built with different languages, frameworks and other tools: solidity, brownie, hardhat, javascript, reactJS, among others.

Here are some util commands related to git submodules:

```
# After cloning this repository, run:
$ git submodule init

# and then:
$ git submodule update

# these commands will clone each submodule repo.
```
